<p id="demo" class="para">DESCRIPTION: The Originals, a spin-off of The Vampire Diaries, centers <br>on three of the Mikaelson siblings: Klaus (Joseph Morgan), Elijah (Daniel Gillies), <br>and Rebekah (Claire Holt). The Mikaelson family are also commonly known as <br>"the Originals" due to the fact that they are the first vampires ever to exist. <br>Klaus is the son of a witch and a werewolf, and his quest to unleash his hybrid <br>nature was detailed in The Vampire Diaries. The backdoor pilot, "The Originals", <br>which aired on April 25, 2013, also revealed that the werewolf Hayley (Phoebe Tonkin), <br>with whom Klaus had a drunken one-night stand, is pregnant with his child.</p>
