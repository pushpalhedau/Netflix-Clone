# Netflix-Clone

I developed an Social media website clone using HTML, CSS and JS for the frontend, PHP for the backend, and MySQL for the database. 
The website featured a responsive design, seamless navigation with CSS. Through this project, I gained experience in building interactive interfaces, developing user-friendly frontend UI, and creating a smooth surfing experience.
